# Final_Project

## Purpose

The goal of the project is to address the issue of voice intellegibillity issues
while within enclosed spaces.The reason behind of the project is to create a user-friendly interface with calculation and data visualziation tools to allow
us to analyze RT60 values.


## Why it Exist

Enclosed spaces with prolonged reverberation times can be disruptive to
our hearing. Our project aims to take on this problem by enabliong users to analyze and visualize RT60 values,
identify requency ranges with extended reverb times, and ultimatley engineer solutions for improved voice clarity.
By using our program, we will be able seamlessesly import, clean, visualize, analyze, and model the data related to (RT60) in
enclosed spaces

## Instructions
When the program is ran a window will appear with the button option to input your wav. file
then you can select three button options to select between three radio frequencies being high medium, and low.
And the button to display the frequency after you have chosen.
